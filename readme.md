# NDVI Web App using Dash Plotly

This project is a web application built using Dash and Plotly that allows users to visualize and analyze NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data. NDVI is a commonly used index in remote sensing to quantify vegetation health and density. The app provides functionality to select a date range, generate a time series plot of NDVI values, and download the data as a CSV file.

## Features

- Select a date range to visualize NDVI time series data.
- Generate an interactive Plotly line chart for the selected date range.
- Download the NDVI data as a CSV file for further analysis.
